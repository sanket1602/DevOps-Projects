# DevOps-Projects

Hi, I approached a couple of "tech influencers" to share this list however, they have not done it. I don't know whats the story behind 'not sharing free resources is'. The only reason I asked them is because they have a higher audience reach. So, I decided to do this myself.

I hope this helps people who are new to the field of DevOps or even experienced people. Some of them don't need a test environment. Please feel free to add if you know more. I will keep updating this repo.

P.S. I do not own any of these. If you own any of them and want them removed from this list (for whatever reasons), please do let me know. I will remove them.
